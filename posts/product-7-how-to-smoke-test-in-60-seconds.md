## I Spent 3 Months Building Something Nobody Wanted

Last year, I had a "brilliant" SaaS idea. Developer analytics dashboard with AI-powered insights.

I spent months:
- Building the backend API
- Designing the database schema
- Implementing authentication
- Creating a beautiful dashboard

Launched it. **Zero customers.**

The problem? I never validated if anyone actually wanted this. I just assumed they did.

**This is the #1 mistake developers make.** We build first, validate later. The correct order is the opposite.

## Smoke Testing: Validate Before You Build

A smoke test is a minimal landing page that:
- Describes your product idea
- Captures early interest (email waitlist)
- Measures real demand

**If nobody clicks your "Get Started" button on a landing page, they won't use your full product either.**

The trick is: you need to deploy this landing page FAST. Not in 2 weeks. In 60 seconds.

## The 60-Second Smoke Test Template

I created a Next.js landing page template specifically for smoke testing. It's pre-configured with:

- ✅ Clean, conversion-focused design
- ✅ Email capture form
- ✅ One-click Vercel deployment
- ✅ Built-in analytics
- ✅ Mobile responsive

**Repository:** [eylulsenakumral/smoke-test-landing-pages](https://github.com/eylulsenakumral/smoke-test-landing-pages)

## Tutorial: Deploy in 60 Seconds

### Step 1: Click Deploy (30 seconds)

Visit the repository and click "Deploy with Vercel":

```
https://github.com/eylulsenakumral/smoke-test-landing-pages
```

The Vercel deployment wizard opens. Connect your GitHub, click "Deploy".

### Step 2: Customize (30 seconds)

Your site is live. Now edit the content:

1. Open the deployed Vercel project
2. Click "Edit code" to open in GitHub Codespaces
3. Edit `app/page.tsx`:

```tsx
// Before
const hero ***REMOVED*** {
  title: "Your SaaS Idea",
  description: "Describe what it does in one sentence",
  cta: "Join Waitlist"
};

// After (your actual idea)
const hero ***REMOVED*** {
  title: "Developer Analytics with AI",
  description: "Understand how users interact with your code using AI-powered insights",
  cta: "Get Early Access"
};
```

### Step 3: That's It

Commit changes. Vercel auto-redeploys. Your smoke test is live.

**Total time: Under 60 seconds.**

## What Comes Next

Your smoke test landing page is now live. Here's what to do:

### 1. Share It

- Post on Twitter/X
- Share in relevant Discord/Slack communities
- Post on Reddit (carefully, in relevant subs)
- Ask friends to share

### 2. Measure Interest

The template includes simple analytics. Track:
- Page views
- Email signups
- Click-through rate

### 3. Make the Decision

**After 1-2 weeks**, you'll know:

| Metric | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| 50+ emails | Build the MVP |
| 10-49 emails | Pivot the idea or niche down |
| <10 emails | Move to the next idea |

**This is the only validation that matters.** Not your gut feeling. Not friends saying "cool idea." Real emails from real people.

## The Smoke Test Template Features

The template includes everything you need:

### Pre-Built Components
- Hero section with value proposition
- Feature highlights
- Email capture form (ready for your email service)
- Social proof section
- FAQ section
- Mobile-responsive design

### Tech Stack
- **Next.js 14** - App Router, Server Components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Vercel** - One-click deployment
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development

### Email Integration Ready

Connect any email service:

```tsx
// app/actions.ts
export async function subscribe(formData: FormData) {
  const email ***REMOVED*** formData.get('email');

  // Option 1: Resend
  await fetch('https://api.resend.io/emails', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, list_id: 'xxx' })
  });

  // Option 2: ConvertKit
  await fetch('https://api.convertkit.com/v3/subscribers', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, api_key: 'xxx' })
  });

  // Option 3: Your database
  await db.waitlist.create({ data: { email } });
}
```

## Real Example: How I Use This

Last month, I had an idea: "GitHub Actions monitoring service."

Instead of building it, I:
1. Deployed the smoke test template (60 seconds)
2. Customized the content (5 minutes)
3. Shared on Twitter/X

**Result:** 87 emails in 10 days.

**Decision:** Build the MVP.

If I had built the full product first, I would have wasted 2+ months on something that might have flopped.

## Why This Works

Smoke testing works because it:
- **Filters bad ideas early** - Save months of work
- **Validates real demand** - Not vanity metrics
- **Builds an audience** - You have customers when you launch
- **Tests messaging** - See what resonates

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Building Too Much

The smoke test should take **1 hour max**, not 1 week.
- Don't build authentication
- Don't build the actual product
- Don't obsess over design
- Don't add multiple features

**Your landing page is the test.** Nothing else.

### Mistake 2: Not Sharing Enough

Deploying isn't enough. You need eyeballs.
- Share on at least 3 platforms
- Ask 5 friends to share
- Post in relevant communities

**If 10 people see your landing page, that's not enough data. Aim for 100+.**

### Mistake 3: Ignoring the Results

If nobody signs up, that's a result. It means "nobody wants this."

**Don't say "I'll build it anyway."** Move to the next idea.

## Advanced: A/B Test Your Value Proposition

The template supports multiple variants. Test different headlines:

```tsx
// Variant A
const hero ***REMOVED*** {
  title: "Developer Analytics with AI",
  description: "Understand user behavior in your codebase"
};

// Variant B
const hero ***REMOVED*** {
  title: "Debug Production Issues Faster",
  description: "AI-powered insights for GitHub repositories"
};
```

Deploy both variants. See which gets more signups.

## What Happens After Validation

You hit your target metric (50+ emails). Now what?

1. **Email your waitlist** - Ask them what they want
2. **Build the MVP** - Just the core feature
3. **Invite waitlist to beta** - They're your first customers
4. **Launch** - You already have an audience

This is how you build a SaaS that people actually want.
