```markdown
## What

`ghprof-cli` is a Go-based CLI tool that profiles GitHub Actions workflows across multiple runs to detect cache misses and generate optimization hints.

## Why

GitHub Actions cache hits are binary. A single cache misconfiguration can cost hundreds of CI minutes monthly. Existing tools show single-run metrics; ghprof-cli aggregates across history to reveal patterns.

## How

Built with Go + Cobra. Fetches workflow history, parses cache logs, aggregates hit/miss rates, runs hints engine against anti-patterns.

## Install

brew tap eylulsenakumral/tap && brew install ghprof-cli

## Example

ghprof-cli analyze --workflow ci.yml --runs 50

Output shows cache hit rate + miss patterns + optimization hints.

## Differentiation

Multi-run analysis ✓ | Cache miss patterns ✓ | Optimization hints ✓
(Unlike act, gh run view, GitHub UI — single-run only)

## 🔥 Reply Templates (Use These)

### "Cool tool!" type
```
Thanks! Built it after burning through CI minutes on cache keys that changed every run. The multi-run analysis surfaced patterns I couldn't see in single runs.
```

### "How does it work?" type
```
It fetches workflow run history via GitHub REST API, parses cache action logs (restore/save operations), aggregates hit/miss rates, then runs a hints engine against common anti-patterns (missing restore-keys, dynamic keys, etc.).
```

### "Open source?" type
```
Yes, MIT licensed. Repo at https://github.com/eylulsenakumral/ghprof-cli. Contributions welcome — especially hint rules and export formats.
```

### "Comparison to X?" type
```
Great question. Unlike [X], ghprof-cli focuses specifically on cache miss patterns across multiple runs. It doesn't try to do everything — just surface the patterns that waste CI minutes.
```

### "Pricing?" type
```
CLI is free and open source (MIT). Exploring team features for $19-29/month for teams with multiple repos, but core profiling stays free.

## 🚨 Kill Criteria — When to Switch to Reddit

### After 2 hours (16:00 TR):
- **< 5 upvotes** AND not front page → Go Reddit
- 5+ upvotes but not front page → Wait

### After 6 hours (20:00 TR):
- **< 15 upvotes** → Accept, go Reddit
- **< 10 comments** → Save learning, go Reddit

---

## 🔄 Reddit Fallback (If HN Fails)

### r/devtools (+3h from HN post)
Title: `[CLI] GitHub Actions workflow profiler - visualize bottlenecks`

```
Built this to debug slow CI/CD pipelines. Visualizes workflow execution times, identifies bottlenecks, and suggests optimizations.

GitHub: eylulsenakumral/ghprof-cli

Would love feedback from the community!
```

### Sequence: r/devtools → r/devops → r/github

## 💡 Golden Rules

1. **Patience first 5 min** — Algorithm lag is real
2. **Reply within 2 min** to first comment
3. **NO self-upvotes** — Death penalty
4. **Stay human** — Conversational, not marketing
5. **Accept failure gracefully** — If dead, switch to Reddit instantly
