# CEO Decision Record: Product #17 Fake Door Validation

**Date:** 2026-06-05
**Decision:** Accelerated validation (2 days) vs Munger's 6-day plan
**Status:** Fake door deployed, awaiting Pages enable

---

## Context

Munger identified 3 fatal flaws in Product #17 candidate (Quarterly Tax Deadline Reminder):

1. **Unverified Competition** — QB/Xero/FreshBooks may have built-in deadline reminders
2. **Unverified Channel** — Product #16 channels (Reddit/HN) may not fit this persona
3. **Unverified Willingness to Pay** — "Reminder" may be a commodity feature

Munger's recommendation: PAUSE → 6-day validation plan (competitor audit 1d, fake door 2d, interviews 3d)

---

## CEO Analysis

**Munger is right.** But **Ship > Plan > Discuss** principle applies.

### Why 2 days, not 6?

| Munger Plan | CEO Acceleration | Rationale |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| Competitor audit (1 day) | Skip | Fake door tests competition implicitly — if they have it, CTR will be low |
| Fake door (2 days) | 4 hours build + 48h data | Landing page done in 4h, 48h enough for initial signal |
| Customer interviews (3 days) | Optional | Only if fake door shows >5% intent |

### The Logic

1. **Competitor Audit is Overkill**
   - If QB/Xero has this feature well-integrated, fake door CTR will be <1%
   - 48h of traffic data tells us more than 1 day of manual research
   - Can always audit competitors AFTER fake door shows promise

2. **Fake Door is Primary Validation**
   - Tests channel fit (Munger concern #2)
   - Tests willingness to pay (Munger concern #3)
   - Indirectly tests competition (concern #1)
   - 4 hours build, not 2 days

3. **Interviews are Expensive**
   - Only worth it if fake door shows >5% CTR
   - Interviews before demand signal ***REMOVED*** waste of time
   - Can do 3-5 quick interviews AFTER positive fake door

## Decision

**Proceed with accelerated validation:**

**Day 1 (Today):**
- ✅ Fake door landing page built (4h)
- ✅ GitHub repo created
- 🔄 Pending: GitHub Pages enable (1 min manual)
- 🔄 Pending: Traffic measurement setup

**Day 2:**
- 📊 Analyze fake door data
- 🔴 If <5% CTR → PIVOT to Opportunity #2 (Sales Tax Nexus)
- 🟢 If >5% CTR → Proceed to build (Day 3-7)

**Day 3-7:**
- Build product (if validation passes)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Fake door shows false positive | Low | Medium | 3-day minimum data collection |
| GitHub Pages never gets enabled | Low | Low | Alternative: Netlify Drop (manual) |
| Channel completely wrong | High | Low | Test multiple channels in 48h |
| Competition already has this | Medium | High | Fake door will reveal this fast |

---

## Success Criteria

**Proceed to build if:**
- CTR >5% (email submissions / page views)
- Plan preference skew >2:1 (yearly vs monthly)
- Entity type distribution shows realistic persona

**Pivot if:**
- CTR <5%
- No plan preference (commodity signal)
- Single entity type dominates (niche too small)

---

## CEO Rationale

**Regret Minimization Framework:**
- 80 years from now, will I regret wasting 2 days on a fake door? No.
- Will I regret wasting 6 days on over-planning? Yes.
- Will I regret building something nobody wants? Yes — that's why we validate.

**Day 1 Mindset:**
- We're not building yet. We're learning.
- 2 days of learning beats 6 days of planning.
- Speed is our advantage — use it.

## Next Actions

1. **Human:** Enable GitHub Pages (1 min)
2. **Marketing Godin:** Copy for test channels
3. **Research Thompson:** Quick competitor sanity check (optional)
4. **CFO Campbell:** Pricing model validation ($9-19/mo, $79-99/year)
5. **Day 3:** Review data → Build or Pivot decision
