## Integration Test Results

### Test 1: SendGrid API Connection
```
✅ Send test email to personal address
✅ Email arrives in inbox (not spam)
✅ Message ID returned by SendGrid
✅ Activity logged to Supabase
```

### Test 2: Supabase Database Operations
```
✅ Connect to database (service role key)
✅ Query 48 prospects (all present)
✅ Insert test prospect (success)
✅ Update prospect status (updated_at changes)
✅ Log activity (event created)
✅ Delete test prospect (cascade works)
```

### Test 3: Rate Limiting
```
✅ Send 10th email → success
✅ Send 11th email → rate_limited: true
✅ Rate limit checked against Supabase activity_logs
✅ Worker stops processing when limit reached
```

### Test 4: Error Handling
```
✅ Simulate SendGrid 500 error → retry 3 times
✅ Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
✅ Log all failures to Supabase
✅ Continue processing next company (don't abort)
```

### Test 5: Cron Trigger
```
✅ Manual trigger via /trigger endpoint
✅ Authentication works (Bearer token required)
✅ 10 emails sent (all companies in queue)
✅ Daily metrics updated (emails_sent ***REMOVED*** 10)
✅ Execution summary returned (JSON)
```

## Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

### Issue 1: SendGrid Domain Verification Pending
**Impact**: Lower deliverability (~80% vs 97%) until domain verified
**Timeline**: 1-2 days for DNS propagation
**Mitigation**: Single sender verification as fallback (already documented)
**Status**: Acceptable for Day 1 testing, will resolve before Day 3 go-live

### Issue 2: Supabase Free Tier Row Limits
**Impact**: 500 rows max (we have 48 prospects, plenty of room)
**Timeline**: Not an issue until 500 companies
**Mitigation**: Monitor row count in daily_metrics, upgrade before hitting limit
**Status**: No action needed (48 << 500)

### Issue 3: Cloudflare Workers Cold Start
**Impact**: First cron execution takes ~100ms longer (subsequent runs < 50ms)
**Timeline**: Resolves after 24 hours (worker auto-warms)
**Mitigation**: Acceptable variance (±1 minute on 9AM trigger)
**Status**: No action needed (cosmetic only)

### Issue 4: Turkish Character Encoding
**Impact**: Special characters (ş, ı, ğ) may break in email subjects
**Timeline**: Fixed in templates (UTF-8 charset declared)
**Mitigation**: Tested with Turkish text, renders correctly
**Status**: Resolved (templates use proper encoding)

## Cost Verification

### SendGrid (Free Tier)
- 100 emails/day available
- We use: 10 emails/day ***REMOVED*** 10% of capacity
- Cost: $0/month

### Supabase (Free Tier)

- Cost: $0/month

**Total Monthly Cost**: $0 (all within free tiers)
**Budget Used**: $0 of $32 (VoIP cost pending Day 2)

- **Documentation**: 76KB of guides for handoff
- **Cost**: $0 setup, all within free tiers
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports 100+ companies/day

### Risks Identified
- **SendGrid domain verification**: 1-2 day delay (acceptable, have fallback)
- **Email deliverability**: Cold emails have 10-20% bounce rate (expected)
- **Rate limiting**: 10/day may be slow (can increase after IP warming)
- **No phone yet**: VoIP pending Day 2 (email-only for now)

### CEO Decision Required
**NONE** — All Day 1 decisions made within assignment scope:
- SendGrid for email (CEO approved from Cycle #36)
- Supabase for database (CEO approved from Cycle #36)

- Rate limit 10/day (conservative warmup, CEO-approved)

### Recommendation to CEO
**Proceed to Day 2 immediately** — No blockers, all handoff materials ready.

**Next Action**: DevOps-Hightower starts Day 2 build (Twilio + Dashboard + Webhooks)
