# LeadQualifier v4 — Manual Test Checklist

**Purpose:** Exploratory testing guide for v4 analytics + v3 regression
**Time Required:** ~2 hours for full pass
**Browser:** Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (document which)

**Instructions:**
- Check box when test passes
- Note failures with repro steps

## Part 4: Performance & Scale

### Query Performance

**Setup:** Need 100+ leads for meaningful test. Quick method:
1. Open DevTools Console
2. Run: `for(let i***REMOVED***0; i<100; i++) { /* simulate lead creation */ }`
(Or use CSV import if available)

- [ ] **Dashboard Load:**
  - [ ] With 100 leads, Overview tab loads <1s
  - [ ] With 100 leads, all tabs switch <500ms
  - [ ] No UI freeze or lag

- [ ] **Query Speed (Console timing):**
  - [ ] Run `histogram()` query → <50ms
  - [ ] Run `topN()` query → <40ms
  - [ ] Run `trends()` query → <80ms

**Note actual times:** _____________________

### localStorage Quota

- [ ] **Quota Warning:**
  - [ ] Add leads until near 5MB (monitor Application → Storage)
  - [ ] Warning toast appears at 80% quota
  - [ ] Export button promoted

- [ ] **Quota Exceeded:**
  - [ ] Attempt to add beyond limit
  - [ ] Graceful error (not crash)
  - [ ] User can delete old leads to free space

**Exploratory:** What happens if quota exceeded during migration?

## Part 5: Browser Compatibility

**Repeat core tests in each browser:**

| Browser | Version | Migration | Dashboard | v3 Features | Performance | Pass/Fail |
|---------|---------|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Chrome | _______ | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | _____ |
| Firefox | _______ | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | _____ |
| Safari | _______ | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | _____ |
| Edge | _______ | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | _____ |

**Critical:** Any console errors? Note here: _____________________
