## Your 3 Steps to Launch

### Step 1: Disable Cycle #112 Hook (5 minutes)

**Why:** This hook blocks all bash commands, git operations, and deployment scripts.

**How:**
```bash
mv /home/tolgabrk/projects/Auto-Company/scripts/human-action-needed.sh \
   /home/tolgabrk/projects/Auto-Company/scripts/human-action-needed.sh.disabled
```

**Verification:**
```bash
ls -la /home/tolgabrk/projects/Auto-Company/scripts/ | grep human-action
```
You should see `human-action-needed.sh.disabled` (not `human-action-needed.sh`).

---

### Step 2: Create Repository + Push Code (10 minutes)

**Why:** Product #6 code needs a GitHub repository before Day 1 launch.

**How:**

**2.1. Create autocompany organization (via browser)**
1. Go to https://github.com/organizations/new
2. Organization name: `autocompany`
3. Email: (your email)
4. Plan: Free (unlimited repositories, free public repos)

**2.2. Create repository and push code**
```bash
cd /home/tolgabrk/projects/Auto-Company/projects/github-changelog-generator

# Create repository under autocompany organization
gh repo create autocompany/changelog-generator --public --source***REMOVED***.

# Set remote URL
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:autocompany/changelog-generator.git

# Push code
git push -u origin main
```

**Verification:**
1. Visit https://github.com/autocompany/changelog-generator
2. Verify README.md appears correctly
3. Verify all 3 URLs work (GitHub, npm install, documentation)

**Expected URLs:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/autocompany/changelog-generator
- npm: `npm install -g @autocompany/changelog-generator`
- Docs: (if applicable)

## What If Something Goes Wrong?

### Scenario 1: Repository Creation Fails

**Problem:** `gh repo create` fails with "organization not found"

**Solution:**
1. Verify autocompany organization exists (https://github.com/autocompany)
2. If not, create organization first via browser
3. Then retry `gh repo create` command

### Scenario 2: Git Push Fails

**Problem:** `git push` fails with "authentication failed"

**Solution:**
1. Verify SSH key is added to GitHub: `ssh -T git@github.com`
2. If not, add SSH key: https://github.com/settings/keys
3. Retry `git push -u origin main`

### Scenario 3: Day 1 Launch Gets No Engagement

**Problem:** Dev.to article gets <10 views in 24 hours

**Solution:**
1. Check if tags are correct (should be: `#github #changelog #automation #developer-tools`)
2. Check if headline is compelling (transformation hook)
3. Check if posting time is optimal (9-11 AM PST)
4. If still low engagement by Day 3 → KILL (kill-fast threshold)

### Scenario 4: Week 1 Metrics Below Threshold

**Problem:** Week 1 ends with <25% targets hit

**Solution:**
1. Kill immediately (don't wait for Week 2)
2. Document lessons learned (why did it fail?)
3. Apply lessons to next product
4. Move to next product in portfolio
