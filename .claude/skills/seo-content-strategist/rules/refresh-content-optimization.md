## Content Refresh & Optimization

**Impact: HIGH**

Content decay is inevitable — rankings drop, information becomes outdated, competitors publish better versions. Refreshing existing content often delivers better ROI than creating new content. A page that once ranked #3 can return to #3 faster than a new page can get there.

### Content Decay Signals

| Signal | How to Detect | Priority |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Ranking drop** | Position decreased 5+ spots | High |
| **Traffic decline** | >20% drop YoY | High |
| **CTR decrease** | Lower click-through rate | Medium |
| **Engagement drop** | Higher bounce, less time on page | Medium |
| **Outdated info** | Year references, old stats | High |
| **Broken elements** | Dead links, missing images | High |
| **SERP changes** | Different content now ranking | High |
| **Competitor publish** | New content outranking yours | Medium |

### Content Audit Framework

```
1. Export all content (URL, traffic, rankings)

2. Categorize by performance:
   ├── Stars — High traffic, maintain
   ├── Opportunities — Good content, needs refresh
   ├── Underperformers — Low traffic despite potential
   └── Prune candidates — No traffic, no potential

3. For each bucket:
   ├── Stars → Protect, link to from new content
   ├── Opportunities → Prioritize for refresh
   ├── Underperformers → Deep optimization or consolidate
   └── Prune → Redirect, consolidate, or delete
```

### Content Decision Matrix

| Traffic | Rankings | Content Quality | Action |
|---------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| High | Top 5 | Good | Maintain, protect |
| High | Declining | Good | Quick refresh |
| Medium | 6-20 | Good | Optimize for top 3 |
| Low | 20+ | Good | Major refresh |
| Low | None | Poor | Prune or consolidate |
| None | None | Any | Delete or redirect |

### Good Refresh Strategy

```
Original post: "Kubernetes Secrets Best Practices"
├── Published: Jan 2022
├── Current ranking: Position 12 (was #4)
├── Traffic: Down 60% from peak
└── Issue: Outdated K8s versions, competitors updated

Refresh checklist:
✓ Updated K8s version references (1.28+)
✓ Added new sections on external secrets operator
✓ Updated code examples for current APIs
✓ Added table comparing native vs external secrets
✓ Rewrote intro with current security landscape
✓ Added 2024 to title
✓ Updated screenshots
✓ Added FAQ section (from PAA)
✓ Improved internal linking to newer related posts
✓ Updated publish date

Result: Back to position 4 within 6 weeks
```

### Bad Refresh Strategy

```
✗ Just changing the date:
  "Updated for 2024!" (but content unchanged)
  → Google detects this, may penalize

✗ Adding fluff:
  Original: 1,500 words of good content
  "Refreshed": 2,500 words (1,000 words of filler)
  → Dilutes quality, hurts user experience

✗ Over-optimizing:
  Added keyword 47 more times
  → Keyword stuffing, will backfire

✗ Changing URL:
  Moved /blog/secrets-management to /guides/secrets-guide
  → Lost all existing link equity
```

### Refresh Priority Framework

Score each article (1-5 scale):

| Factor | Weight | Score |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Current traffic** | 30% | How much do you have to lose? |
| **Ranking potential** | 25% | Currently #8-20 ***REMOVED*** high potential |
| **Business value** | 25% | Drives conversions, key topic |
| **Refresh effort** | 20% | Quick win vs major rewrite |

Prioritize highest combined scores first.

### What to Update in a Refresh

| Element | When to Update | How to Update |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **Title tag** | CTR declining or SERP changed | Test new angle, add year |
| **Meta description** | CTR below benchmark | Rewrite for click appeal |
| **Intro paragraph** | Hook is weak | Lead with value, curiosity |
| **Statistics** | Data older than 1 year | Find current stats, cite sources |
| **Screenshots** | UI has changed | Capture current interface |
