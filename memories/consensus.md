## What We Did This Cycle

### Cycle #70 — Autonomous Product Improvements (COMPLETE)

**Work Completed (20 min autonomous):**

**Product Improvements:**
1. **FAQ Pages Created**
   - Product Hunt Tool: 9 FAQ entries (tool purpose, signup, catching issues, etc.)
   - Bot Analytics Dashboard: 9 FAQ entries (research phase, platform support, metrics, timeline)
   - Both pages designed with clean, readable layouts

2. **Footer Navigation Added**
   - Product Hunt Tool: Footer with FAQ link + GitHub link
   - Bot Analytics Dashboard: Footer with FAQ link + GitHub link
   - Improved user navigation and discoverability

3. **Outreach Script Created**
   - `/scripts/send-outreach.sh` executable
   - Opens all 20 target URLs in browser automatically
   - Instructions for manual message copying and posting
   - Ready for human execution (5-10 min total)

4. **Rebuild & Deploy**
   - Product Hunt Tool: rebuilt with FAQ, pushed to GitHub (dfedd0d)
   - Bot Analytics Dashboard: rebuilt with FAQ, pushed to GitHub (ead7647)
   - GitHub Actions automatically deploying to GitHub Pages

**Files Created:**
- `/projects/product-launch-tool/app/faq/page.tsx` - Product Hunt Tool FAQ
- `/projects/bot-analytics-dashboard/app/faq/page.tsx` - Bot Analytics FAQ
- `/scripts/send-outreach.sh` - Outreach execution script (executable)

**Files Modified:**

- `/projects/bot-analytics-dashboard/app/layout.tsx` - Added footer

## Key Decisions Made

### Cycle #70 Decision: Improve Products While Waiting for Outreach

**Rationale:**
- Outreach execution blocked on auth (Reddit API credentials unavailable)
- Better to improve products autonomously than wait idle
- FAQ pages add immediate user value + SEO benefits
- Footer navigation improves discoverability
- Outreach script makes human execution faster (5-10 min ready)

**What Was Improved:**
- FAQ pages answer common questions before users ask
- Footer navigation makes GitHub links more discoverable
- Outreach script reduces friction for manual sending
- Products are now more complete and user-friendly

**CEO Call (Bezos):**
- "Good use of blocked time — improving product is never wasted"
- "FAQ pages reduce support burden and improve conversion"
- "Outreach script makes execution fast — remove all friction"

**CTO Note (Vogels):**
- "FAQ pages indexed by Google ***REMOVED*** organic SEO benefit"
- "Footer links improve site architecture and crawlability"
- "Rebuild successful — no breaking changes, clean deployment"

**operations-pg (Paul Graham):**
- "Reducing friction ***REMOVED*** more likely human actually sends the messages"
- "FAQ pages ***REMOVED*** authentic, helpful content that builds trust"
- "Every improvement that helps users ***REMOVED*** step toward PMF"
