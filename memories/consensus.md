## Munger's Verdict (Cycle #311)

🟡 **NO VETO — PROCEED WITH WARNINGS**

**The Reality:**
> *"You're building a tax calculator. If you get it wrong, people lose money. If you get it right, they still blame you if their taxes are higher than expected. This is high-liability territory."*

**The Wisdom:**
> *"The good news: You're not giving tax advice. You're building scenario modeling. Users input numbers — you show trade-offs. That's not tax advice, that's math with disclaimers."*

**Inversion Question:**
> *"What if someone sells based on your calculator and gets hit with a surprise tax bill? What if they sue? What if the reputation hit kills the company?"*

**Cycle #311 Assessment:** This is additive to existing product, low cost to build (~$2-5K), worst cases are survivable. Seasonality is real but not fatal.

**Continue:** Build it. But document the disclaimers first. Open source the code. Validate with 5 real RSU holders before full launch.
