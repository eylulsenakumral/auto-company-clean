## Engagement Plan

### Reply Templates

**For "What bot is this for?"**
```
Great question! I built this for a Telegram bot (chatbot automation), but the dashboard works for Discord and Slack bots too. The core problem is the same: you need to measure command usage, user flows, and retention to understand what's working.

The analytics are bot-native (commands, not pages) so you don't have to force web metrics into a bot context.

Happy to share more about the architecture if you're interested!
```

**For "Is this open source?"**
```
Not currently open source—it's a hosted dashboard to keep the maintenance burden low for users (no infra setup, no scaling worries).

The architecture is event-based (bot sends events to API, dashboard aggregates and visualizes). I'm planning to write up the design decisions soon—there are some interesting challenges in making bot analytics feel natural rather than like web analytics awkwardly repurposed.

Is open sourcing something you'd want to see? Curious what would be most valuable.
```

**For "How does this compare to X?" (Mixpanel, Amplitude, etc.)**
```
Good question! The big difference is mental model:

Web analytics (Mixpanel, etc.): Pages, sessions, funnels
Bot analytics: Commands, conversations, user flows

Bots aren't websites—users don't "browse" a bot. They run commands, sometimes in chains. The dashboard is designed around bot-native patterns:

- Command chains (not page funnels)
- Conversation depth (not session length)
- Interaction diversity (not page views)

If you tried to use web analytics for a bot, you'd end up with metrics that don't make sense. This is purpose-built for how bots actually work.
```

**For "Pricing?"**
```
Currently free for small bots (<1K users). Paid plans for larger bots—but honestly, I'm still figuring out the right pricing model.

The philosophy: bot analytics shouldn't be expensive. Most bot devs are indie hackers or small teams. If pricing is a blocker, I'd rather work with you than lose you as a user.

What would make this a no-brainer for you?
```

**For "Can I self-host?"**
```
Not right now—it's a hosted service to keep maintenance simple. No infra setup, no scaling worries, no database migrations.

That said, I've thought about self-hosting. The challenge is that the value is in the dashboards and aggregation logic, not just the code. A self-hosted version would need the same pre-built mental models.

Is self-hosting a hard requirement for you? Curious what's driving the need (data privacy? cost? control?).
```

**For "Show me the dashboard!"**
```
Fair request! Here's a live demo: [LINK]

What you're seeing:
- Real-time metrics (active users, commands/hour)
- Command usage (which commands get used)
- User retention (week-over-week cohorts)
- Command chains (how users flow through the bot)

The dashboard is designed to answer "what's happening with my bot?" in <10 seconds. Deep dives available, but the default view is signal, not noise.

What would make this more useful for you?
```

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Posts flagged as self-promotion**
- **Mitigation:** 70% value, 30% product. Lead with insights, not features.
- **Response:** If flagged, apologize, adjust, repost with better ratio.

**Risk 2: Low engagement (<5 upvotes, <3 comments)**
- **Mitigation:** Test angles in Week 2 engagement. Do posts resonate?
- **Response:** If low engagement, analyze why (title? timing? angle?) and iterate.

**Risk 3: Hostile community pushback**
- **Mitigation:** Authentic tone, transparency ("solo dev, built this because...").
- **Response:** Apologize, clarify intent, engage constructively. Don't argue.

**Risk 4: High signups, low activation**
- **Mitigation:** Onboarding flow tested (2 minutes to first value).
- **Response:** If <50% activation, improve onboarding immediately.

### Pre-written Opening Hooks

**Value-first hooks (no product mention):**
- "Built a bot, hit 1K users, learned these 5 things about retention"
- "Bot analytics is weirdly different from web analytics. Here's why."
- "My bot was dying. These 3 metrics saved it."
- "Zero to 10K bot users: What the data taught me"
- "Week 1 bot launch: 5 mistakes analytics caught early"

**Problem-first hooks:**
- "Why bot analytics is broken (and how I'm trying to fix it)"
- "Most bot metrics are vanity. Here are the ones that matter."
- "Bot developers are obsessed with the wrong metrics"
- "The metric that saved my bot: command chains"
- "Bot analytics on a budget: my $0 solution"

**Story-first hooks:**
- "How I built analytics for my bot (and what I learned)"
- "My side project bot has 100 users. Here's what analytics taught me."
- "From side project to real product: when analytics tipped the scale"
- "Building bot dashboards: what I learned from 3 attempts"
- "Bot observability: treating bots like production services"

### Pre-written Value Contributions

**For analytics discussions:**
- "From my bot analytics experience, the metric that correlates with retention is command diversity. Users who run 3+ different commands in first session are 4x more likely to stick around."

**For bot architecture discussions:**
- "Event-based tracking works best for bots. Every command, callback, and interaction is an event. Pre-aggregate on write, query on read. Scales way better than polling."

**For growth discussions:**
- "Reddit communities have been the best growth channel for my bot (60% of users, 40% higher retention than other sources). Something about the dev-in-dev-to-dev dynamic."
