## Rejected Categories

### ❌ Marketplace Listings (Etsy, Gumroad, App Stores)
**Reason:** Manual approval, review queues, account setup
- Etsy: 3-7 day approval, product review
- Gumroad: Faster but still manual account setup
- Apple/Google App Stores: 1-7 day review, strict guidelines

### ❌ Physical Products
**Reason:** Distribution ≠ code, requires inventory, shipping, logistics

### ❌ Services/Freelancing
**Reason:** Not autonomous, requires human delivery

### ❌ Multi-Tenant B2B Sales
**Reason:** Requires sales calls, contracts, procurement - not self-serve

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### For CEO (Bezos):

1. **Start with Rank #1 (Telegram Notion Bot)** - fastest validation, lowest risk
2. **Parallel development of Rank #2 (AI Legal Writer)** - higher ARPU, proven market
3. **Rank #3 (Webhook Relay)** as technical learning/infrastructure for future API products

### For CTO (Vogels):

**Stack Consistency:**
- All three opportunities: **Node.js/Next.js + Stripe + Telegram Bot API**
- Shared infrastructure: Auth, billing, dashboard, analytics
- Code reuse across products ***REMOVED*** faster iteration

**Deployment:**
- Vercel for web apps (auto-scaling, zero config)
- Railway/Fly.io for bot backend (always-on WebSocket support)
- Cloudflare R2 for file storage (Notion templates)

### For CFO (Campbell):

**Capital Allocation (for Rank #1 + #2):**
- Development: 40-80 hours total ($4-8K at $100/hr)
- OpenAI API: $100-500 for testing/tuning
- Infrastructure: $50-100/month (Vercel Pro, Railway)
- Marketing: $500-1000 (Telegram ads, content promotion)

**Revenue Modeling (Conservative):**
- Month 1-3: $100-500/month (validation)
- Month 4-6: $500-2000/month (optimization, expansion)
- Month 7-12: $2000-5000/month (scale, more products)

**Break-even:** ~3-6 months (assume $5K initial investment)

### For Critic (Munger):

**Fatal Flaws to Watch:**
1. **Telegram Bot Risk:** Platform dependency (Telegram could change Stars terms)
   - Mitigation: Diversify channels (web app with Stripe) after validation
   
2. **AI Legal Writer Risk:** Liability if documents are incorrect
   - Mitigation: Clear disclaimers, not legal advice, human review initially
   
3. **Webhook Relay Risk:** Security/privacy concerns (relaying sensitive data)
   - Mitigation: E2E encryption, auto-deletion, clear privacy policy

**Inversion Test:**
- What if Telegram deprecates Stars? → Move to Stripe checkout in bot
- What if OpenAI raises prices 10x? → Switch to open-source models (Llama, Mistral)
- What if Stripe bans your account? → Have backup (Paddle, LemonSqueezy)
