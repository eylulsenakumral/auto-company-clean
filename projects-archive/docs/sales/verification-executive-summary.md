# Data Quality Verification - Executive Summary

**Date**: 2026-06-03
**Task**: Verify 43-company Bursa automotive outreach list
**Duration**: 30 minutes (automated validation)
**Decision**: ❌ NO-GO for outreach

---

## One-Page Summary

### The Problem
Sales-Ross created a 47-company outreach list. QA-Bach verified data quality. **Result: 50% score - Outreach blocked.**

### The Numbers

| Metric | Status | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Quality Score** | 50.0% | Below 80% threshold |
| **Missing Phones** | 30/47 (64%) | Can't call 64% of targets |
| **Missing Emails** | 40/47 (85%) | Can't email 85% of targets |
| **Geographic Errors** | 1/47 (2%) | Toyotetsu in Kocaeli, not Bursa |
| **Duplicates** | 1 potential | BEM Bosch listed twice |
| **Missing Critical Data** | 18/47 (38%) | No address/OSB/sector info |

### The Reality Check

**What we thought**: 47 companies ready for outreach
**What we have**: 7 companies with complete data (15%)

**Risk assessment**:
- 85% missing emails ***REMOVED*** cold calling without introduction
- Expected failure rate: 60-80% without email pre-qualification
- Brand damage: Unprofessional to outreach with wrong data

### The Fix

**Option A: Full Research (Recommended)**
- 5.5 hours manual research
- Call OSB directories → Get tenant lists
- Corporate websites → Find facility contacts
- LinkedIn → Find Plant Manager/EHS emails
- Phone verification → Ask operators for contacts

**Expected outcome**: 60%+ companies with contact data
**Timeline**: Research today → Launch tomorrow

**Option B: Staged Launch**
- Start with 7 verified companies
- Research remaining 40 in parallel
- Expand as data becomes available

**Expected outcome**: Immediate momentum, but slower expansion
**Timeline**: Start now → Full outreach by week 2

### The Viable Companies

**Ready for immediate outreach (7 companies)**:

1. **AKMETAL** (Tier-2) - +90 224 242 02 02 - info@akmetalas.com
2. **Ototrim Panel** (Tier-1) - +90 224 243 81 40 - info@ototrim.com
3. **AKWEL** (Tier-2) - +90 224 280 68 00 - info@akwel-automotive.com
4. **A-PLAS** (Tier-2) - +90 (224) 707 00 77 - info@a-plasltd.com
5. **SVB Grup** (Tier-2) - 0 (224) 411 04 01 - satis@svbotomotiv.com.tr
6. **Borçelik** (Tier-1) - +90 224 280 40 00 - (email missing)
7. **Bosch Rexroth** (Tier-1) - +90 224 275 00 00 - (email missing)

### The Critical Path

**High-priority research targets (Tier-1, high-value)**:
1. Coşkunöz Metal Form (1773 employees) - Missing email
2. Bosch (Global supplier) - Missing email
3. Oyak Renault (1000+ employees) - Missing phone + email
4. TOFAŞ (1000+ employees) - Missing phone + email
5. Magna Otomotiv (Global supplier) - Missing phone + email
6. Yazaki (Japanese supplier) - Missing phone + email

### The Geographic Error

**Toyotetsu** (Row 11):
- Listed as: Bursa automotive supplier
- Actually: Gebze/Kocaeli (area code 262, not Bursa 224)
- Phone: +90 (262) 658 87 10
- Action: Remove from Bursa list OR move to Kocaeli list

### Decision Required

**CEO-Bezos must choose**:

1. **Full Research** - 5.5 hours, then launch (recommended)
2. **Staged Launch** - Start with 7 companies, research in parallel
3. **Hybrid** - Research Tier-1 only (2 hours), launch Tier-2 with partial data

**Quality gates before launch**:
- [ ] >60% companies have phone OR email (currently 40%)
- [ ] 100% verified in Bursa province (currently 98%)
- [ ] 0 duplicate contacts (currently 1 potential)
- [ ] All Tier-1 companies have at least one contact method
- [ ] Data quality score >70% (currently 50%)
