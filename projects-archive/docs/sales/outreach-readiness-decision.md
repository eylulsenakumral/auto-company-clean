## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Issues

#### 1. Outreach Waste (Critical)
**Problem**: 85% missing emails means cold calling without email pre-qualification.
**Impact**: 60-80% call pickup rate without email introduction.
**Cost**: Wasted sales effort, damaged brand reputation.

#### 2. Geographic Misclassification (Critical)
**Problem**: Toyotetsu listed as Bursa but actually in Gebze/Kocaeli (area code 262).
**Impact**: Wasted outreach to wrong region.
**Fix**: Remove or move to Kocaeli list.

#### 3. Duplicate Contacts (Medium)
**Problem**: BEM Bosch potentially listed twice.
**Impact**: Double outreach, confusion, unprofessional appearance.
**Fix**: Verify if same company or different divisions.

### Medium-Risk Issues

#### 4. Generic Emails (Low Conversion)
**Problem**: 6 companies have only info@ emails.
**Impact**: 20-30% response rate vs 60% for direct emails.
**Mitigation**: Call to ask for specific contact person.

#### 5. Missing OSB Data
**Problem**: 18 companies missing OSB location.
**Impact**: Can't optimize route planning for site visits.
**Fix**: Research OSB directories.

## Recommended Action Plan

### Option A: Full Research Then Launch (Recommended)

**Timeline**: 5.5 hours research → Launch same day

**Phase 1: OSB Directories (30 min)**
1. Call NOSAB: 0 (224) 411 09 00 → Request tenant contact list
2. Call Kayapa OSB: +90 224 493 23 26 → Request tenant contact list
3. Search DOSAB/Uludağ OSB websites for directories

**Expected outcome**: 10-15 contacts found

**Phase 2: Corporate Research (2 hours)**
1. Research Tier-1 companies (Magna, Yazaki, Faurecia, Delphi)
2. Search corporate facility locators
3. Find press/media contacts (often direct)

**Expected outcome**: 5-8 Tier-1 contacts found

**Phase 3: LinkedIn Research (1 hour)**
1. Search Plant Manager/EHS Manager for each company
2. Export personal emails

**Expected outcome**: 10-15 personal emails

**Phase 4: Phone Verification (2 hours)**
1. Call companies with phone but no email
2. Ask operator for EHS/Plant Manager contact
3. Verify address and company details

**Expected outcome**: 10-15 contacts verified

**Final Quality Check**: Re-run validation script
**Launch Criteria**: >60% companies have at least one contact method

---

### Option B: Staged Launch (Alternative)

**Week 1**: Launch to 7 verified companies
**Week 1-2**: Research remaining 40 companies in parallel
**Week 2**: Expand outreach as research completes

**Pros**:
- Immediate momentum
- Learn from initial 7 calls
- Research doesn't block outreach

**Cons**:
- Smaller initial batch
- May need to pause if patterns emerge

---

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | Option A (Full Research) | Option B (Staged) |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Time to first contact** | 5.5 hours | Immediate |
| **Data quality** | 90%+ | 15% → 90% over time |
| **Outreach efficiency** | High (right people) | Low (generic/missing) |
| **Reputation risk** | Low | Medium |
| **Learning speed** | Slow (no early data) | Fast (early feedback) |

---

## Final Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation: Option A (Full Research)

**Reasoning**:
1. High-value Tier-1 companies deserve proper preparation
2. Missing data ***REMOVED*** wasted outreach ***REMOVED*** damaged reputation
3. 5.5 hours research saves 20+ hours of wasted calls
4. Quality data ***REMOVED*** 3x higher conversion rate

### Secondary Recommendation: Option B (Staged)

**If urgent**: Start with 7 verified companies while researching rest
- Focus on Tier-1 high-value targets first
- Use learnings to refine outreach for remaining companies

## Next Action

**Immediate**: Update `memories/consensus.md` with decision

**Choose one**:
1. **Full Research**: "Proceed with 5.5-hour research, then launch"
2. **Staged Launch**: "Start with 7 companies, research in parallel"
3. **Hybrid**: "Research Tier-1 only (2 hours), launch Tier-2 with partial data"

**Decision Maker**: CEO-Bezos
**Consult**: CFO-Campbell (cost/benefit), Sales-Ross (outreach strategy)
