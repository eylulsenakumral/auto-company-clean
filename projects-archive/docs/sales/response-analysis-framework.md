├─ COUNT REPLIES
│  ├─ 0 replies → GO TO T+48h CHECK (continue waiting)

├─ COUNT REPLIES
│  ├─ 0 replies → PIVOT TO DENIZLI (execute pivot plan)
│  ├─ 1 reply → DEEP EVALUATION (call + qualify)

└─ COUNT DEMOS BOOKED
   ├─ 0 demos → OPTIMIZE MESSAGING (A/B test)

| Criteria | Questions | Score (0/1/2) |
|----------|-----------|--------------|

## Part 3: Pattern Extraction Guidelines

### What to Track (Winning Patterns)

If 2+ replies, analyze:

**Subject Lines:**
- Which opening hook worked? ("Denizli'de", "Sürdürülebilirlik", "İhracat")
- Length: Short (3-5 words) vs Long (6-10 words)?
- Personalization: First name vs Company name?

**Value Props:**
- Which pain point resonated? (Energy cost, worker safety, compliance)
- Which benefit stood out? (20% savings, 24/7 monitoring, EU compliance)
- Social proof: Did they mention "diğer fabrikalar"?

**Timing:**
- Send time: Morning (9-11), Lunch (12-14), Afternoon (15-17)?
- Day: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday?
- Response time: Within 2h, 4h, 24h?

**Channel:**
- Email only vs Email + Phone follow-up?
- Which triggered the reply?

### What to Track (Losing Patterns)

If 0 replies by T+48h, analyze:

**Delivery Issues:**
- Bounce rate >5%? → Email list hygiene problem
- Open rate <20%? → Subject line failed
- Click rate <3%? → CTA/offer failed

**Content Issues:**
- No value prop clarity? → Too vague
- Too technical? → Lost them
- Too salesy? → Distrust

**Timing Issues:**
- Send during busy times? (Month-end close, production peaks)
- Wrong decision maker? → Reached wrong person

**Targeting Issues:**
- Wrong company size? → Too small/big
- Wrong industry? → Not a fit
- Wrong geography? → Not accessible

## Part 4: Pivot Criteria (If-Then Decision Matrix)

### Scenario A: 0 Replies by T+48h → PIVOT TO DENIZLI

**Decision Trigger:** Zero replies after 48 hours

**Action Plan (Execute Immediately):**

1. **Stop current campaign** → Pause any follow-ups
2. **Root cause analysis** → Review subject line, list quality, timing
3. **Pivot messaging** → New angle for Denizli textile cluster
4. **New target list** → 20 Denizli textile manufacturers
5. **New outreach sequence** → More aggressive, phone-first

**Denizli Pivot Messaging:**
```
Subject: Denizli'de Tekstil Üreticilerine Özel - Enerji Tasarrufu

Selam [İsim],

Denizli'deki tekstil üreticilerinin %40'ı enerji maliyetlerinden 
düşünüyor. Sizin [Şirket] için aynı riski taşımayın.

[Case Study]: Bursa'daki bir müşterimiz, 3 ayda %18 enerji tasarrufu 
sağladı. İş güvenliği incidentları %60 düştü.

Denizli'de pilot yapmak istiyoruz. Sıfır maliyet, 4 hafta sonuç.

Haftaya brief yapıyor musunuz?

[İsim]
```

## Closing Notes

**This framework is operational, not theoretical.**

- Use it at T+24h and T+48h.
- Document decisions in `memories/consensus.md`.
- Update metrics after each review.
- Scale what works, kill what doesn't.

**Remember the CFO's guidance:**
> "2+ replies ***REMOVED*** Build automation. 1 reply ***REMOVED*** Evaluate quality. 0 replies ***REMOVED*** Pivot to Denizli."

**This is how we build a predictable sales machine.**
