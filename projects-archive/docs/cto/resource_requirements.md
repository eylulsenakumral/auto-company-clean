## Executive Summary

NextVision occupational_safety modülü için **minimum production resource requirements** tanımlandı. Pilot deployment (4 kamera) için **2 GPU + 16GB RAM + 200GB disk** gereklidir.

**Critical Finding:** GPU resource management eksik. Single GPU failure ***REMOVED*** total system failure.

---

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Specification (Pilot - 4 Cameras)

#### Edge Device (On-Premise at Factory)

| Component | Minimum | Recommended | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **GPU** | 1x NVIDIA T4 (16GB VRAM) | 2x NVIDIA T4 (16GB VRAM each) | YOLO inference GPU-bound. 1 GPU ***REMOVED*** 80 FPS capacity, 2 GPUs ***REMOVED*** 160 FPS (headroom) |
| **CPU** | 8 cores (Intel Xeon/AMD EPYC) | 16 cores | RTSP ingestion + API + background workers |
| **RAM** | 16 GB | 32 GB | Frame buffer + Redis + PostgreSQL + OS overhead |
| **Storage** | 200 GB SSD | 500 GB NVMe | Video archival (30 gün × 4 kamera × 5 GB/gün ***REMOVED*** 600 GB) |
| **Network** | 1 Gbps | 10 Gbps | RTSP streams (4 × 5 Mbps) + API + internal traffic |

#### Vogels' Assessment

> **GPU is the bottleneck.** Single GPU deployment ***REMOVED*** single point of failure.
> Minimum production-ready config: **2 GPUs** (active-active or active-passive).
> Cost delta: +$500/month. Failure cost: System down ***REMOVED*** customer churn.
> **Verdict: Budget for 2 GPUs.**

### Storage Breakdown

```
Total Storage: 500 GB (recommended)
├─ System + Docker Images:       50 GB
├─ PostgreSQL Data:             20 GB
├─ Redis Persistence:            5 GB
├─ MinIO Video Storage (30 gün): 400 GB
│   └─ 4 cameras × 5 MB/min × 60 min × 8 hr × 30 gün ***REMOVED*** 288 GB
│   └─ Overhead + metadata ***REMOVED*** 400 GB
└─ Buffer + Logs:               25 GB
```

**Growth Projection (Multi-Factory):**

```
1 factory (4 cameras):   400 GB/month
5 factories (20 cameras): 2 TB/month
10 factories (40 cameras): 4 TB/month
```

**Vogels' Recommendation:**
> Start with 500 GB local storage. At 80% capacity, trigger archival to cold storage (S3 Glacier equivalent).

## Network Requirements

### Bandwidth Calculation

```
RTSP Streams (4 cameras @ 30 FPS, 640x480, H.264):
├─ Per camera: 5 Mbps (worst case)
├─ Total inbound: 4 × 5 ***REMOVED*** 20 Mbps
└─ Total outbound (API + monitoring): 2 Mbps

Peak bandwidth: 22 Mbps
Average bandwidth: 15 Mbps (motion-adaptive encoding)
```

### Latency Requirements

| Connection | Max Latency | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| RTSP Camera → Edge Device | 10 ms | Local network, minimal jitter |
| Edge Device → PostgreSQL | 1 ms | Local container, localhost |
| Edge Device → MinIO | 1 ms | Local container, localhost |
| Edge Device → Customer Network | 50 ms | VPN tunnel for remote access |

### Firewall Requirements

```yaml
# Required inbound ports (from LAN)
inbound:
  - port: 443
    proto: TCP
    source: Factory LAN
    desc: HTTPS API access
  - port: 9001
    proto: TCP
    source: Management subnet
    desc: MinIO console (admin only)

# Required outbound ports (to internet)
outbound:
  - port: 443
    proto: TCP
    desc: Telegram Bot API (notifications)
  - port: 53
    proto: UDP/TCP

  - redis: 6379
  - minio: 9000
  - yolo-service: 8000
  - api: 3000
```

## Financial Requirements

### One-Time Costs (Pilot Setup)

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Edge Device (2x GPU, 32GB RAM, 500GB NVMe) | $3,500 | Capital expenditure |
| Network switch (10 Gbps) | $500 | Factory network upgrade |
| UPS + Rack | $300 | Power protection |
| Installation + Travel | $1,000 | On-site setup |
| **Total One-Time** | **$5,300** | |

### Monthly Recurring Costs

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Edge Device hosting (electricity + cooling) | $150 | Factory-provided space |
| Internet connection (100 Mbps dedicated) | $100 | Factory network upgrade |
| Backup storage (cloud archival) | $50 | 200 GB/month to S3 Glacier |
| Monitoring service (Grafana Cloud) | $0 | Self-hosted alternative |
| Telegram Bot API | $0 | Free tier |
| **Total Monthly** | **$300** | |

### Pilot Revenue (30 Days @ $1)

```
Revenue: $1 (pilot pricing)
Net margin: $1 - $300 ***REMOVED*** -$299 (loss leader)
```

**Vogels' Assessment:**
> Pilot pricing ($1) operationally irrelevant. Focus on **conversion pricing** ($500/month post-pilot) for ROI calculation.

### Post-Pilot Pricing Model

**Projected Monthly Cost (Single Factory):**

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Edge Device depreciation | $100 | 36-month amortization |
| Hosting + Internet | $300 | Factory network |
| Operations (on-call) | $500 | 20 hours/month @ $25/hr |
| Backup + Archival | $100 | Cloud storage + retention |
| **Total Cost** | **$1,000/month** | |

**Gross Margin Target:**
```
Target price: $1,500/month
Cost: $1,000/month
Gross margin: $500/month (33%)
```

**Vogels' Pricing Principle:**
> **Margin > Complexity.** If operations cost > 50% of revenue, simplify or raise prices.
> Current: $500 ops cost on $1500 price ***REMOVED*** 33% ✅ Acceptable.

## Scalability Requirements

### Horizontal Scaling (Multi-Factory)

**Per-Factory Resource Requirements:**

| Component | 1 Factory | 5 Factories | 10 Factories |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Edge Devices** | 1× 2-GPU | 5× 2-GPU | 10× 2-GPU |
| **Central Services** | Shared | Shared | Shared |
| ├─ PostgreSQL | 4 CPU, 8 GB | 8 CPU, 16 GB | 16 CPU, 32 GB |
| ├─ Redis | 2 CPU, 4 GB | 4 CPU, 8 GB | 8 CPU, 16 GB |
| ├─ MinIO | 4 CPU, 8 GB | 8 CPU, 16 GB + 2 TB | 16 CPU, 32 GB + 5 TB |
| └─ API Cluster | 2 instances | 4 instances | 8 instances |

**Central Infrastructure (Optional):**

```yaml
# Cloud-hosted central services (alternative to edge-only)
architecture: hybrid_edge_cloud

edge:
  - RTSP ingestion (thin client)
  - Frame buffering (Redis)
  - YOLO inference (GPU)

cloud:
  - PostgreSQL (managed)
  - MinIO (S3)
  - API cluster (auto-scaling)
  - Notification service
  - Monitoring (Grafana Cloud)

trade_offs:
  - Pros: Horizontal scaling, centralized ops, simplified updates
  - Cons: Network latency, bandwidth cost, single point of failure
```

**Vogels' Scaling Recommendation:**
> **Stay edge-only until 10 factories.** Cloud overhead (latency, bandwidth) outweighs benefits at small scale.
> At 10+ factories, evaluate hybrid architecture.

| **Data Durability** | 99.99% | No detection data loss |
| **Recovery Time** | < 5 minutes | Service restoration |
| **Data Recovery** | < 1 hour | Database restoration |

### Failure Mode Coverage

  gpu_crash:
    detection: Health check failure (YOLO service)
    recovery: CPU fallback activation
    time_to_recover: 30 seconds
    data_loss: 0 (frames in Redis buffer)

  camera_disconnect:
    detection: RTSP frame timeout
    recovery: Exponential backoff reconnect
    time_to_recover: 2 minutes (5 retries)
