## Usability Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: First-Time Bot Users
**Problem:** Users don't know how to interact with bots

**Mitigation:**
- Clear welcome message explaining how to use
- Large, obvious buttons (no ambiguity)
- Show preview before requiring payment

### Risk 2: Payment Confusion
**Problem:** Users don't understand Telegram Stars

**Mitigation:**
- Show current Stars balance before payment
- Explain Stars in welcome message ("Pay with Telegram Stars - like App Store credit")
- Link to Telegram's Stars FAQ in /help

### Risk 3: Template Delivery Failure
**Problem:** Notion link doesn't work or user can't access

**Mitigation:**
- Test all links before listing
- Provide /support command for help
- Add "How to duplicate" instructions in delivery message

### Risk 4: Buyer's Remorse
**Problem:** Users want refund immediately after purchase

**Mitigation:**
- Show detailed preview before purchase
- Clear description of what's included
- No refunds policy stated in /help (Telegram Stars limitation)

### Risk 5: Template Doesn't Meet Expectations
**Problem:** Template is different than what user imagined

**Mitigation:**
- Screenshot preview (real images, not mockups)
- Detailed "what's included" list
- "Perfect for" section to set expectations
- Use case examples

---

## Key Decisions

### Q: Why Telegram over web marketplace?
**A:**
- Zero friction (already in Telegram)
- Native payments (Stars ***REMOVED*** instant, no Stripe/PayPal)
- Viral distribution (easy to share bot link)
- Mobile-first (Telegram is mobile-native)

### Q: How many categories to start?
**A:** 4 categories for MVP
- More categories ***REMOVED*** more complexity
- 4 is enough to show variety without overwhelming
- Can expand based on demand

### Q: What template metadata is essential?
**A:**
1. **Name** (required)
2. **Price in Stars** (required)
3. **Rating** (social proof, helps decision)
4. **One-line description** (quick scan)
5. **Screenshot** (preview before purchase)
6. **"What's included" list** (set expectations)

Nice-to-have later: tags, use case icons, difficulty level

### Q: How to handle template delivery?
**A:** Direct Notion link in message
- No verification steps
- No external web app
- User taps link → Notion opens → duplicates template
- Simplest possible flow

### Q: What onboarding for Telegram bot newcomers?
**A:**
- Welcome message explains how it works
- All actions via buttons (no commands to memorize)
- Show "How it Works" option in main menu
- Assume zero bot knowledge

## Success Metrics (Week 1)
