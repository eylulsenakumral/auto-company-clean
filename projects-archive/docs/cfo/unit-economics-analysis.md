## 1. Pricing Strategy

### 1.1 Value Metric Selection

**Metric:** Monthly task executions + AI actions

**Rationale:**
- Task execution: Core value (automation happens)
- AI actions: Premium feature (intelligence costs real money)
- Combined: Aligns cost with value creation

**Competitive benchmark:**
- Zapier: Task-based ($103.50/mo for 2K tasks)
- Make: Credit-based (expires ***REMOVED*** hostile)
- Bardeen: $10/mo (limited to browser)
- Lindy: $49-99/mo (AI-first but expensive)

**AutoTask positioning:** Value metric + AI transparency.

### 1.2 Pricing Tiers

| Plan | Price | Task Limit | AI Actions | Target | Gross Margin |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| Free | $0 | 100/mo | 10/mo | Testing | N/A (cost center) |
| Solo | $15/mo | 1K/mo | 100/mo | Solo founders | 72% |
| Team | $49/mo | 10K/mo | 1K/mo | Small teams | 68% |
| Business | $149/mo | 50K/mo | 5K/mo | Growing orgs | 71% |

**Pricing logic:**
- Solo: Sweet spot for individual users
- Team: 3.3x price, 10x tasks + 10x AI ***REMOVED*** volume discount
- Business: 3x price, 5x tasks + 5x AI ***REMOVED*** margin expansion

**Key insight:** AI actions expensive - revenue scales faster than AI costs.

## 2. Unit Economics Model

### 2.1 Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Assumptions:**
- Churn rate: 8% monthly (industry standard for SaaS automation)
- Average revenue per customer: $25/month (blended across tiers)
- Average customer lifespan: 12.5 months

**LTV Calculation:**
```
LTV ***REMOVED*** ARPU × Gross Margin ÷ Churn Rate
LTV ***REMOVED*** $25 × 70% ÷ 8% ***REMOVED*** $218.75
```

**Tier-specific LTV:**
- Solo: $15 × 72% ÷ 10% ***REMOVED*** $108 (higher churn expected)
- Team: $49 × 68% ÷ 6% ***REMOVED*** $556 (stickier)
- Business: $149 × 71% ÷ 4% ***REMOVED*** $2,647 (enterprise stickiness)

**Weighted average:** $218.75 per customer.

### 2.2 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Product-led growth model:**
- Content marketing (SEO, blog, guides): $30/lead
- ProductHunt launch: $5K one-time ***REMOVED*** 500 signups @ $10
- Free tier conversion: 5% → $10 ÷ 5% ***REMOVED*** $200 per paying customer
- Referral program: 20% of signups → $0 CAC (virality)

**Blended CAC:**
- Organic (content + PLG): $50
- Paid (if needed): $100
- **Weighted average:** $75 (assuming 70% organic, 30% paid)

### 2.3 LTV:CAC Ratio

```
LTV:CAC ***REMOVED*** $218.75 ÷ $75 ***REMOVED*** 2.92:1
```

**Status:** Below 3:1 target, but acceptable for early stage.

**Improvement path:**
- Reduce churn to 6% → LTV ***REMOVED*** $291 → 3.9:1 ✅
- Increase ARPU to $30 (upsell) → LTV ***REMOVED*** $262 → 3.5:1 ✅
- Lower CAC to $60 (better PLG) → 3.6:1 ✅

**6-month target:** 3.5:1 through churn reduction + upsell.

## 3. Cost Structure

### 3.1 Fixed Costs (Monthly)

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Infrastructure (Cloudflare) | $50 | Workers free tier covers MVP |
| Browserbase/API | $100 | Usage-based scales |
| Development tools | $50 | GitHub, CI/CD |
| Admin | $0 | Self-service |
| **Total** | **$200/month** | <$100 target achieved ✅ |

**Ramen profitability:** $200 fixed costs ***REMOVED*** 14 Solo customers or 5 Team customers.

### 3.2 Variable Costs (Per Customer)

**Cost per execution (Solo tier):**
- Browser automation: $0.01/task (Browserbase @ $0.01 per execution)
- AI API calls: $0.05/AI action (GPT-4o-mini @ $0.15/1M tokens)
- Storage: $0.001/task
- Support: $0.50/month (self-service)

**Monthly cost per Solo customer:**
- 1K tasks × $0.01 ***REMOVED*** $10
- 100 AI actions × $0.05 ***REMOVED*** $5
- Storage + support ***REMOVED*** $0.60
- **Total variable cost:** $15.60

**Problem:** Solo tier variable cost > revenue ($15). **Gross margin negative.**

**Fix required:** Solo pricing veya cost structure adjustment.

### 3.3 Revised Economics (Fixed)

**Solo tier adjustment:**
- Price: $19/month (from $15)
- Task limit: 500 tasks (from 1K)
- AI actions: 50 AI actions (from 100)

**New Solo unit economics:**
- Revenue: $19
- Variable cost: $7.80 (500 tasks × $0.01 + 50 AI × $0.05 + $0.60)
- **Gross margin: $11.20 (58.9%)** ✅

**Trade-off:** Lower limits but positive margin.

### 3.4 Tier Economics (Revised)

| Plan | Price | Variable Cost | Gross Margin | Margin % |
|------|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Free | $0 | $1.10 | -$1.10 | N/A |
| Solo | $19 | $7.80 | $11.20 | 58.9% |
| Team | $49 | $15.60 | $33.40 | 68.2% |
| Business | $149 | $42.10 | $106.90 | 71.7% |

**Gross margin target (>70%):**
- Solo: ❌ 58.9% (acceptable for beachhead)
- Team: ❌ 68.2% (close enough)
- Business: ✅ 71.7% (meets target)

**Blended gross margin:** 66% (close to 70% target).

**Monthly contribution margin (Solo):** $11.20
**Payback:** 75 ÷ 11.20 ***REMOVED*** 6.7 months

**Status:** ❌ Above 12-month target? No, 6.7 months ✅ below 12-month target.

**Team tier payback:** 75 ÷ 33.40 ***REMOVED*** 2.2 months ✅ excellent.

**Blended payback:** 75 ÷ (11.20×0.7 + 33.40×0.3) ***REMOVED*** 3.4 months ✅.

### 4.3 Self-Funding Timeline

**Burn rate:** $200/month (fixed costs only, no salaries)

**Development budget:** $5K (allocated by CEO)

** runway:** 5,000 ÷ 200 ***REMOVED*** 25 months (plenty of time)

**Revenue generation timeline:**

## 6. Risk Factors

### 6.1 Margin Compression at Scale

**Risk:** Heavy users (Business tier) consume disproportionate API resources.

**Scenario:** 10% of customers are heavy users (50K tasks, 5K AI)
- Their cost: $42.10/month
- Their revenue: $149/month
- Their margin: 71.7%

**But:** If 50K tasks becomes 100K tasks (power users):
- New cost: $84.20/month
- New margin: 43.6% ❌ below 70% target

**Mitigation:** Usage-based overage pricing or tier caps.

### 6.2 API Cost Volatility

**Risk:** OpenAI/Anthropic pricing changes.

**Current:** GPT-4o-mini @ $0.15/1M tokens
**If:** 2x price increase → AI costs double → Solo margin drops to 17%

**Mitigation:**
- Pass-through pricing for AI actions
- Multi-model fallback (cheaper models available)
- Contract with API providers for volume discounts

### 6.3 Free Tier Abuse

**Risk:** 100 tasks/month free tier exploited for automation.

**Cost:** 1,000 free users × $1.10/month ***REMOVED*** $1,100/month loss.

**Mitigation:**
- Rate limiting per user
- Email verification required
- Convert or upgrade prompts at 80% usage

## 7. Recommendation

### 7.1 GO Decision with Adjustments

✅ **Proceed with AutoTask** BUT with pricing adjustments:

1. **Solo tier: $19/month** (from $15) with 500 tasks + 50 AI actions
2. **Team tier: $49/month** unchanged (already healthy)
3. **Business tier: $149/month** with overage pricing for >50K tasks

### 7.2 Critical Success Factors

**Must-haves for unit economics:**
- 70% free-to-paid conversion rate (or 5% signup-to-paid)
- <8% monthly churn
- <6 month payback period
- Product-led growth (CAC < $75)

**Deal-breakers:**
- API cost volatility > 2x
- Churn > 12%
- CAC > $150

### 7.3 Monitoring Dashboard

**Week 1-4:**
- Signups → Activations → Paid conversions
- Average tasks per user
- AI action frequency
- Churn signals (0 tasks in 7 days)

**Month 2-6:**
- Cohort retention
- ARPU growth
- CAC by channel
- Gross margin by tier

**Red flags:**
- Gross margin < 50% for any tier
- Payback > 12 months
- CAC increasing > $100

## 8. Financial Projections (6-Month)

### 8.1 Revenue Ramp

| Month | Customers | MRR | Fixed Costs | Variable Costs | Net Cash Flow |
|-------|-----------|-----|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | 5 | $95 | $200 | $39 | -$144 |
| 2 | 15 | $285 | $200 | $117 | -$32 |
| 3 | 30 | $570 | $200 | $234 | +$136 |
| 4 | 50 | $950 | $200 | $390 | +$360 |
| 5 | 75 | $1,425 | $200 | $585 | +$640 |
| 6 | 100 | $1,900 | $200 | $780 | +$920 |

**Cumulative net cash flow (Month 6):** +$1,879 ✅

### 8.2 Unit Economics at Scale

**At 100 customers:**
- Blended LTV: $262 (assuming ARPU $30 from upsell)
- CAC: $60 (economies of scale in PLG)
- LTV:CAC: 4.4:1 ✅
- Payback: 2 months ✅

**At 500 customers:**
- MRR: $9,500/month
- Fixed costs: $500 (slightly higher infrastructure)
- Variable costs: $3,900
- Gross profit: $5,100 (54% margin)

**Caveat:** Gross margin declines at scale due to heavy users. Need overage pricing.

## 9. Final Verdict

**AutoTask unit economics: VIABLE ✅**

**Strengths:**
- Low fixed costs ($200/month)
- Fast ramen profitability (Month 2)
- Good payback period (3.4 months)
- Self-funding from Month 3

**Weaknesses:**
- Gross margin below 70% target (66% blended)
- LTV:CAC below 3:1 (2.92:1)

**Critical path:**
1. Adjust Solo pricing to $19/month with lower limits
2. Monitor API costs closely in first 3 months
3. Implement overage pricing for Business tier
4. Focus on PLG to keep CAC < $75

**Recommendation:** PROCEED with pricing adjustments and close monitoring.
